The Mass Adoption Alliance (GACE, Inc.) is a 501(c)(3) public charity. Our mission is empowering youth worldwide by providing educational resources about cryptocurrency, which are readily accessible and freely available, to students and teachers. This education will prepare youth to become self-sovereign adults who are able to store, transact and easily transfer their wealth across borders and without an intermediary. These are the hallmarks of financial freedom.

Today more than 1.6 billion students around the world are enrolled in public, private and home schools. Countless additional youth are displaced due to domestic or cross-border homelessness including the economically disadvantaged, refugees, asylum-seekers and stateless people. Regardless of circumstance, every school-age child deserves to be educated about decentralized cryptocurrencies. Educating youth in turn educates their families and communities; this aligns with the overarching goal of mass adoption as a means to a more peaceful world.
