Mass Adoption Alliance is a 501(c)(3) public charity. Our mission is empowering youth worldwide by facilitating educational opportunities about cryptocurrency and financial privacy, which are readily accessible and freely available. The broader vision is helping prepare youth to become self-sovereign adults who are able to store, transact and easily transfer their wealth across borders and without an intermediary. These are the hallmarks of financial freedom.
